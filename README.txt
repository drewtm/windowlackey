WINDOWLACKEY
a light-based automatic window blinds controller

If you want to build one of these exactly like I did, you will require:
  1x Arduino Pro Mini 5V https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113
  1x sunkee light sensor board http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CW82WZY/
  1x zitrades motor driver board http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6NIMAM/
  1x tiny motors http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009AQLDSS/
  2x 607 bearings http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K85I51I/
  1x SPST switch http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AKVBEN6

It also requires my BH1750FVI Arduino library https://github.com/drewtm/BH1750FVI

You can 3D print the plastic parts from the included STL files.

The wiring in that case is done in-place with small solid-core wire, and locks all the circuit boards together.

The gears and motor are for a ball-chain type blinds mechanism, often found on vertical blinds.

WINDOWLACKEY
a light-based automatic window blinds controller

Building one of these exactly like I did requires:
  Arduino Pro Mini 5V
  Sunkee GY-30 BH1750FVI Digital light intensity Light Sensor Module
  ZITRADES L9110S DC/Stepper Motor Driver Module

The sensor board and the motor driver board are available for cheap on Amazon.

It also requires my BH1750FVI Arduino library.

You can 3D print the case from the included STL files. The wiring in that case is done in-place with small solid-core wire.
